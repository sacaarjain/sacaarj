                        At least, that's what my LinkedIn says. However, there is a lot more to who and what I am, and I'd like to show you a 
                        glimpse of the human behind the flesh. I want this website's main purpose to display my favorite pictures that I have 
                        taken over my the years in my journey into photography; however, I will also link my professional life and display a 
                        slice of who I am.

                    <h3><u>Photography:</u></h3>
                    <p>
                        As a kid, I have always had a knack for photography, whether it be on old digital cameras or phones, I always paid attention to and did my best to 
                        produce great pictures for fun. As I grew older, I became inspired my father to really look into photography as a hobby and when I finally got hands on 
                        my first DSLR camera, I decided to snapshot and record the world and my existence in it. As of now, I have a keen interest in photography, cinematography, 
                        music, and editing. These are just some of my hobbies and I'd like to document my progress in these fields. My pictures on this website include shots from both 
                        my camera and my phone. I am glad to have the privelege and tools to make my interests come to life and will always be thankful of all the people who have supported 
                        and helped me reach here :)

                    <h3><u>My Career Accomplishments:</u></h3>
                    <p>I think my LinkedIn does a great job at showcasing all that I have done, and I will link that in "My Links"; however, there are a 
                        few that I consider significant to me:
                    </p>
                    <h4>Undergradute Research at the Elegant Mind Club Lab:</h4>
                    <p>
                        A lab that let me interact with many emerging technologies while also giving me the experience of managing duties and tasks with great complexities involved. 
                        I worked together with a team of dedicated and bright students who made the experience incredibly worthwhile. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Little Tokyo Service Center:</h4>
                    <p>
                        A volunteering experience of a lifetime that allowed me to apply my skills in something directly useful to my community and its
                        younger generation. I believe as much as it is important to be able to use your skills, you can provide so much more value by sharing and teaching 
                        those same skills to others.
                    </p>
                    <h4>MyCourse</h4>
                    <p>
                        An assignment that put my coding and team management skills to the test as we worked in a team to build a website to improve upon the existing 
                        enrollment system at UCLA. Even amid all difficulties we faced in technical and team-related areas, we were able to finish the project and showcase 
                        it to our class, receiving praise from our TAs for its capabilities.
